## Exploratory Data Analysis for Asutralia RealEastate Dataset

##Purpose and scope of this EDA:
The purpose of this EDA is to explore and analyze a real estate dataset to understand underlying patterns, relationships and trends within the data. We are aiming to identify the factors that affect the house prices in Australia's 5 major cities ( Adelaide,, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney).

##Challenges we faced: 
After importing, exploring and analyzing old datasets, we realized that the DataSet does not support analysis to answer the targeted questions. So we decided to change our dataset and focus only on the Northern Territory region of Australia. 

##Northern Territory region -Property price analysis
+ About the Dataset: 
This dataset contains information on 1000 properties in the NT region of Australia, including location, size, price, and other details.
This dataset provided us with an immense opportunity to practice our data cleaning skills using the python programming language.

##Our goal is to answer the following questions:

+ Target Object : Price
Price Distribution :
Hypothesis question    :  What is the distribution shape of real estate prices in the northern territories  ?
null hypothesis            : property prices are normally distributed. 
Alternative hypothesis : property prices are not normally distributed.

+ Property Distribution
Which property type has the highest demand in the market.
Hypothesis Test Question: null Hypothesis : Apartments are more expensive than the unit.
Alternative hypothesis : Apartments are not more expensive than the unit.

+ Property Feature Analysis
Is there any correlation between number of bedrooms and property price?
Is there any correlation between the number of bathrooms and property price?
Is there any correlation between the parking count and property price?

## Purpose and scope of this EDA
The purpose of this EDA is to explore and analyse a real estate dataset to understand underlying patterns, relationships and trends withing the data.
We are aiming to identify the fectors that affects the house price.

The scope of this EDA is to analyze the following columns:
Price,Bedrooms,Bathrooms,SqFt,City,State,Year_Built,Type,Garage,Lot_Area

Key Questions and Insights we are working upon,
+ Price analysis: 
1.What is the average price of proprties in different cities or states?
2.How does the price districution look like(ex. are there any outliers)
3. Which features (Bedrooms, Bathrooms, SqFt, etc) are mose strongly correlated with the price?

+ Size and Space Analysis:
1. what is distribution of propery size(SqFt) accross different cities or states?
2. How does the number of Bedrooms adn bathrooms corelate with the size of the property?

+ Year Built Analysis:
1. How does the age of the proprty affect the price?
2. what are the most common construction years?

+ Type and garage Analysis:
1. What type of proprties are most common in different cities or states?
2. How does having a garage influence the price and size of the proprty?

+ Hypothesis Testing Questions 
1. Hypothesis: Average Property Prices Differ Between Two Cities
2. Hypothesis: Properties with Garages Have Higher Prices
3. Hypothesis: Property Size (SqFt) Influences Price
4. Hypothesis: Newer Properties (Year Built) Are Priced Higher

+ Tools and Technolody we will be using:
Python programming language, Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter Notebook,Matplotlib, Gihub
