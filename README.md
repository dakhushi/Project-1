## Exploratory Data Analysis for Asutralia RealEastate Dataset

***Purpose and scope of this EDA:***

The purpose of this EDA is to explore and analyze a real estate dataset to understand underlying patterns, relationships and trends within the data.
We are aiming to identify the factors that affect the house prices in Australia's 5 major cities ( Adelaide,, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney).

***Challenges we faced:*** 

After importing, exploring and analyzing datasets, we realized that the DataSet does not support analysis to answer the targeted questions. So we decided to change our dataset and focus only on the Northern Territory region of Australia. 

### Northern Territory region -Property price analysis
+ ***About the Dataset:***

This dataset contains information on 1000 properties in the NT region of Australia, including location, size, price, and other details.

This dataset provided us with an immense opportunity to practice our data cleaning skills using the python programming language.

+ ***Our goal is to answer the following questions:***

+ ***Target Object*** : Price

+ ***Price Distribution :***

Hypothesis question    :  What is the distribution shape of real estate prices in the northern territories  ?

null hypothesis        : property prices are normally distributed.

Alternative hypothesis : property prices are not normally distributed.

+ ***Property Distribution***

Which property type has the highest demand in the market.

Hypothesis Test Question: null Hypothesis : Apartments are more expensive than the unit.

Alternative hypothesis : Apartments are not more expensive than the unit.

+ ***Property Feature Analysis***

Is there any correlation between number of bedrooms and property price?

Is there any correlation between the number of bathrooms and property price?

Is there any correlation between the parking count and property price?
