##Exploratory Data Analysis for Asutralia RealEastate Dataset##

##Purpose and scope of this EDA##
The purpose of this EDA is to explore and analyse a real estate dataset to understand underlying patterns, relationships and trends withing the data.
We are aiming to identify the fectors that affects the house price.

The scope of this EDA is to analyze the following columns:
Price,Bedrooms,Bathrooms,SqFt,City,State,Year_Built,Type,Garage,Lot_Area

Key Questions and Insights we are working upon,
+ Price analysis: 
1.What is the average price of proprties in different cities or states?
2.How does the price districution look like(ex. are there any outliers)
3. Which features (Bedrooms, Bathrooms, SqFt, etc) are mose strongly correlated with the price?

+ Size and Space Analysis:
1. what is distribution of propery size(SqFt) accross different cities or states?
2. How does the number of Bedrooms adn bathrooms corelate with the size of the property?

+ Year Built Analysis:
1. How does the age of the proprty affect the price?
2. what are the most common construction years?

+ Type and garage Analysis:
1. What type of proprties are most common in different cities or states?
2. How does having a garage influence the price and size of the proprty?

+ Hypothesis Testing Questions 
1. Hypothesis: Average Property Prices Differ Between Two Cities
2. Hypothesis: Properties with Garages Have Higher Prices
3. Hypothesis: Property Size (SqFt) Influences Price
4. Hypothesis: Newer Properties (Year Built) Are Priced Higher

+ Tools and Technolody we will be using:
Python programming language, Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter Notebook,Matplotlib, Gihub
